=head1 DESCRIPTION

CatalystX::Resource enhances your App with CRUD functionality.

After creating files for HTML::FormHandler, DBIx::Class
and Template Toolkit templates you get create/edit/delete/show/list
actions for free.

Resources can be nested.
(e.g.: Artist has_many Albums)

You can remove actions if you don't need them.

Example, you don't need the edit action:
    'Controller::Resource::Artist' => {
        ...,
        traits => ['-Edit'],
    },
    
Using the Sortable trait your resources are sortable:
    'Controller::Resource::Artist' => {
        ...,
        traits => ['Sortable'],
    },

=head1 CAVEAT

CatalystX::Resource detaches to '/error404' if a resource cannot be found.
Make sure you implement this action in your App.

as a web service.

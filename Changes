    * ATTENTION: this change breaks stuff!!!
      CatalystX::Resource::TraitFor::Controller::List does no longer stash an
      array reference under $self->resources_key because that is not actually
      needed. If you want to access a list of all resources simply
      use the resultset available in
      $c->stash->{ $self->resultset_key } # Perl code
      OR
      [% $self->resultset_key %] #  Template Tookit

      Update HowTo:
        1) remove any occurence of 'resources_key'
        2) update 'resultset_key'. (e.g.: 'artist_rs' to 'artists')
        3) replace 'artists' with 'artists.all' in your templates

    * change in trait Sortable::move_to()
      instead of passing the new position as Args(1) it has to be passed as
      request parameter.
    * Removed DEPRECATION warning if stash key 'form_attrs' is used.
      'form_attrs' is not merged into attributes used for $form->new() anymore.
      Use 'form_attrs_new' instead.

    * make form_class attr 'rw' to enable  runtime change of the form_class
